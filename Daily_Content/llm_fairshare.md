LLM Token-Aware Throttling: Beyond Simple Request Counting
Traditional API rate limiting counts requests per time window, but this approach falls short for LLM systems where computational costs vary dramatically. A 10-token request and a 10,000-token request have vastly different resource requirements, yet traditional throttling treats them identically.
Modern LLM systems implement token-aware throttling using enhanced token bucket algorithms where:

Each user has a tier-specific bucket capacity
Refill rates scale with subscription level
Request costs calculate the actual compute required based on model size, input length, and maximum output length
The system accounts for the quadratic O(nÂ²) complexity of transformer architectures

In multi-tenant environments, fair sharing mechanisms prevent resource monopolization through:

Weighted fair queuing that allocates processing slots proportionally to user tiers
Separate request queues with dynamic processing rates
Adaptive credit systems where inference costs vary by computational demands
Anti-starvation protections that temporarily boost priority for long-waiting users

When system capacity is exceeded, graceful degradation maintains service through tiered strategies:

Selective load shedding with informative status codes
Request transformation that reduces output token limits
Model fallbacks to smaller, more efficient variants
Dynamic queue management with adjusted timeout policies

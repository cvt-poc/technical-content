I need a detailed technical visualization that explains [TOPIC]. Please create a comprehensive SVG visualization with the following characteristics:

## Content Structure Requirements

### 1. Title and Overview Section
- Clear, descriptive title at the top
- Brief subtitle explaining what will be visualized
- Use professional typography (Arial/sans-serif, appropriate sizing)

### 2. Comparison/Contrast Section (if applicable)
- Side-by-side comparison of:
  - Common misconception vs Reality
  - Expected behavior vs Actual behavior  
  - Traditional approach vs Modern approach
  - Before vs After states
- Use contrasting colors (red/warm for incorrect, green/cool for correct)
- Clear visual separation between concepts

### 3. Component Breakdown
- Show the complete system/concept broken into its core components
- Use visual hierarchy to show relationships
- Include:
  - Component names and descriptions
  - How components interact (arrows, connections)
  - Data flow between components
  - Color coding for different component types

### 4. Step-by-Step Process Flow
- Demonstrate how the concept works in practice
- Show progression through numbered steps or stages
- Include:
  - Initial state
  - Each transformation/step
  - Final state
  - What happens at each stage

### 5. Real-World Example
- Concrete example with actual data/values
- Show the concept applied to a specific scenario
- Include relevant code snippets or configuration
- Demonstrate calculations or transformations

### 6. Common Pitfalls/Misconceptions
- Clearly marked section for what NOT to do
- Side-by-side correct vs incorrect approaches
- Visual indicators (❌ for wrong, ✓ for correct)
- Brief explanations of why each is wrong/right

### 7. Best Practices/Key Insights
- Summarize critical learnings
- Highlight important principles
- Show benefits of correct approach
- Include performance/efficiency comparisons where relevant

## Visual Design Requirements

### Layout
- Canvas size: 1400x[appropriate height] for comprehensive coverage
- Clear sections with rounded rectangles
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Visual hierarchy through size and positioning

### Color Scheme
- Use semantic colors:
  - Red tones (#fee2e2, #dc2626) for errors/misconceptions
  - Green tones (#dcfce7, #22c55e) for correct/success
  - Blue tones (#dbeafe, #3b82f6) for primary information
  - Yellow/Orange (#fef3c7, #f59e0b) for warnings/important notes
  - Purple tones (#e0e7ff, #6366f1) for examples
  - Gray (#f8f9fa, #6b7280) for neutral/background

### Typography
- Headers: 22-28px bold
- Section titles: 16-18px bold
- Body text: 11-14px
- Code/monospace: 10-12px monospace font
- Consistent font family throughout

### Visual Elements
- Rounded rectangles for containers (rx="3-5")
- Arrows with proper markers for flow
- Visual accumulation/stacking where applicable
- Icons or symbols to reinforce concepts
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes

### Code/Technical Elements
- Dark background (#1e293b) for code blocks
- Syntax highlighting with appropriate colors
- Actual, runnable code examples where possible
- Configuration snippets in appropriate format

## Content Guidelines

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure all technical details are correct
2. **Clarity**: Make complex concepts visually understandable
3. **Completeness**: Cover the topic comprehensively
4. **Progression**: Build from simple to complex
5. **Practical**: Include real-world applications
6. **Educational**: Teach both what and why

## Specific Sections to Include

1. **What People Think vs Reality** - Show the mental model gap
2. **How It Actually Works** - Technical deep dive with visuals
3. **Live Example** - Walk through a specific scenario
4. **Common Mistakes** - What goes wrong and why
5. **Correct Implementation** - Best practices visualized
6. **Key Takeaways** - Summary of critical points

Please ensure the visualization is self-contained and could be understood by someone with basic technical knowledge but no prior exposure to [TOPIC].

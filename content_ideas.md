### Prometheus Histogram Metrics for Accurate Latency Monitoring

**Description:** Deep dive into histogram queries (histogram_quantile, bucket sizing).

  ***Critical Technical Insights***

    1. LLM latencies require custom histogram buckets - Default Prometheus buckets miss 60-80% of the distribution range for typical LLM workloads
    2. Phase-specific monitoring is essential - Prefill and decode phases have fundamentally different latency characteristics requiring separate tracking
    3. Recording rules are mandatory at scale - Pre-computing common quantiles reduces query time by 10-100x for high-cardinality deployments
    4. Bucket boundary selection directly impacts SLO accuracy - Poor bucket configuration can introduce 20-30% measurement error
    5. Histogram aggregation order matters - Always sum buckets before calculating quantiles to avoid mathematical errors

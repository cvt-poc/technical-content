## Core Learning Structure

### 1. LLM Infrastructure Fundamentals and Scaling Challenges

#### 1.1 GPU Memory Management and Inference Optimization ⭐
- **Concept**: LLM inference requires careful GPU memory management due to model weights, KV cache, and activation storage. Understanding memory allocation patterns and optimization techniques is crucial for determining scaling boundaries and instance sizing.
- **Key Points**: 
  • Model weights occupy static memory (e.g., Llama-2-70B requires ~140GB in FP16), while KV cache grows linearly with batch size and sequence length
  • PagedAttention (vLLM) enables 24x higher throughput by treating KV cache as virtual memory with 4KB pages
  • Continuous batching can improve GPU utilization from 30% to 85% by dynamically adding/removing requests
  • Memory bandwidth (e.g., 2TB/s on A100) often bottlenecks performance more than compute (312 TFLOPS)
  • Quantization techniques (INT8, INT4) reduce memory requirements by 2-4x with <1% accuracy loss on most tasks
- **Real-World Case Study**: Together.ai implemented continuous batching with PagedAttention for their Llama-2-70B endpoint, increasing throughput from 100 to 2,400 tokens/second on 8xA100 nodes while reducing P50 latency from 2.1s to 0.8s for 512-token completions. This allowed them to serve 24x more concurrent users per GPU.

  • NVIDIA Technical Blog: "Optimizing LLM Inference on GPUs" (2024)

#### 1.2 Request Pattern Analysis and Workload Characterization ⭐
- **Concept**: LLM applications exhibit unique request patterns including power-law distributions in token counts, temporal clustering, and user-specific behaviors. Accurate characterization of these patterns forms the foundation for effective predictive scaling.
- **Key Points**: 
  • Token length distributions typically follow log-normal patterns with mean ~200-500 tokens but long tail extending to 8K-32K
  • Request arrival patterns show 5-10x variation between peak and off-peak hours, with Monday peaks 2.3x higher than weekends
  • User segmentation reveals 80/20 rule: 20% of users generate 80% of token volume, requiring user-aware scaling
  • Conversation context accumulation means subsequent requests in a session require 3-5x more memory than initial requests
  • API rate limits and retry patterns create artificial spikes that must be filtered from prediction models
- **Real-World Case Study**: Anthropic's Claude API analyzed 100M requests over 6 months, discovering that corporate users (B2B) showed predictable 9am-5pm EST patterns while consumer apps had 7pm-11pm peaks. They built separate scaling models for each segment, reducing over-provisioning by 45% and saving $2.1M monthly in GPU costs.

#### 1.3 Cost-Performance Trade-offs in Multi-Model Deployments ⭐
- **Concept**: Modern LLM applications often deploy multiple model variants (different sizes, quantizations, or architectures) to optimize cost-performance trade-offs. Understanding how to route requests and scale different model tiers is essential for economical operation.
- **Key Points**: 
  • Smaller models (7B-13B) handle 60-70% of queries adequately at 10x lower cost than 70B+ models
  • Model routing decisions based on prompt complexity can reduce average cost/request by 65% while maintaining quality
  • Spot instances offer 70-90% discounts but require 3-5 backup instances due to 2-hour preemption notices
  • Cascade architectures (try small→medium→large) increase latency by 20% but reduce cost by 55%
  • Fine-tuned domain-specific models often outperform larger general models at 5x lower serving cost
- **Real-World Case Study**: Perplexity.ai deployed a three-tier system: Mistral-7B for simple factual queries, Mixtral-8x7B for moderate complexity, and GPT-4 for complex reasoning. Their router achieved 89% accuracy in model selection, reducing average cost from $0.012 to $0.004 per query while maintaining 94% user satisfaction scores.

#### 1.4 Latency Budgets and SLA Management
- **Concept**: LLM applications must balance various latency components including model loading, inference, and token generation while meeting strict SLAs. Understanding latency breakdown and optimization opportunities enables effective capacity planning.
- **Key Points**: 
  • Time-to-first-token (TTFT) typically ranges 200ms-2s, while inter-token-latency stays constant at 20-50ms
  • Model loading from disk takes 30-180 seconds for 70B models, necessitating warm instance pools
  • Network latency adds 10-50ms for cross-region deployments, requiring geographic distribution strategies
  • Streaming responses improve perceived latency by 60% for long generations despite same total time
  • P99 latency often 5-10x higher than P50 due to queue buildup, requiring headroom planning
- **Real-World Case Study**: Discord's Clyde bot maintains strict 1.5s TTFT SLA by pre-loading models across 12 regions, implementing request hedging for the 99th percentile, and maintaining 30% capacity headroom. This architecture handles 50M daily messages with 99.9% SLA compliance.

#### 2.2 Anomaly Detection and Demand Spike Prediction ⭐
- **Concept**: LLM workloads experience sudden spikes from viral content, product launches, or cascading failures. Anomaly detection systems must distinguish between legitimate spikes requiring scaling and attacks requiring throttling.
- **Key Points**: 
  • Isolation Forest and LSTM-based autoencoders detect anomalies with 85% precision at 90% recall
  • Social media signals (Twitter volume, Reddit mentions) provide 2-4 hour advance warning for viral events
  • Legitimate spikes show gradual ramp-up (5-10 min) while attacks appear instantly (<30s)
  • Multi-dimensional anomaly scoring considers: request rate, unique users, token distribution, and geographic spread
  • Adaptive thresholds adjust based on time-of-day and day-of-week patterns, reducing false positives by 60%
- **Real-World Case Study**: Character.ai's prediction system integrates Twitter Streaming API, monitoring character name mentions and related hashtags.

  • Action space covers: scale up/down by 1-10 instances, change instance types, or activate spot instances
  • Reward function combines: -$0.01 per GPU-minute, -$1 per SLA violation, +$0.1 per successful request
  • Off-policy learning on 6 months of logs reduces sample complexity by 100x versus online learning
  • Safety constraints via action masking prevent scaling below minimum capacity or above budget limits
- **Real-World Case Study**: DeepMind's internal Gemini serving platform uses a SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent trained on historical data and fine-tuned online. The agent reduced infrastructure costs by 31% while improving P99 latency by 18%, learning complex patterns like pre-scaling for weekly batch jobs.

- **Key Points**: 
  • Bayesian LSTMs provide uncertainty estimates that correlate 0.85 with actual prediction errors
  • Model disagreement in ensembles indicates 3x higher risk of under-provisioning
  • Conformal prediction guarantees coverage with 95% confidence, adding 20-40% safety margin
  • Online learning with exponential weighted averaging adapts to distribution shifts within 2-3 hours
  • Hierarchical models capture user-level, application-level, and global patterns simultaneously
- **Real-World Case Study**: Runway ML's video generation platform combines 7 models (ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, 3 neural variants, and Gaussian Process) with uncertainty-weighted averaging. During model launches, uncertainty spikes trigger conservative scaling (2.5x margin), preventing outages during 8 major releases.

#### 4.4 Failure Recovery and Disaster Resilience
- **Concept**: LLM applications must handle various failure modes from individual GPU errors to entire region outages. Recovery strategies must consider model state, in-flight requests, and the high cost of redundancy.
- **Key Points**: 
  • Checkpoint-based recovery reduces recomputation from hours to minutes for failed instances
  • Request hedging to multiple instances reduces P99 latency by 60% during partial failures
  • Cross-region replication requires careful consistency management for stateful conversations
  • Gradual degradation serves cached or simpler model responses during capacity constraints
  • Chaos engineering practices adapted for LLMs test handling of GPU errors and OOM conditions
- **Real-World Case Study**: Anthropic's multi-region architecture survived a complete US-EAST-1 outage by failing over to US-WEST-2 within 90 seconds. Their stateful session migration preserved conversation context for 98% of active users, with automatic retry logic hiding the failover from end users.

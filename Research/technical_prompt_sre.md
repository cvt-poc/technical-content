You are an expert SRE and platform engineer with deep knowledge in distributed systems, infrastructure automation, and production operations. Generate a comprehensive learning roadmap for the following topic: [TOPIC]

Context: This roadmap is specifically for SREs, DevOps engineers, and platform engineers who need to understand the infrastructure, deployment, scaling, monitoring, and operational aspects of this technology. Focus on production-ready implementations, not theoretical concepts.

Create a hierarchical outline that breaks down this topic into subtopics that can each be learned in under an hour, suitable for hands-on learning and immediate application.

Structure your response EXACTLY as follows:

# [TOPIC] - SRE/Platform Engineering Focused Roadmap

## Prerequisites (Reference Only)
- List 3-5 foundational concepts from an infrastructure/operations perspective
- Focus on tools, platforms, and operational knowledge needed
- Be specific about versions or experience levels required

## Core Learning Structure
[Create 3-4 main categories focused on operational aspects]

### 1. Infrastructure and Operational Fundamentals
[Include subtopics about resource management, capacity planning, and infrastructure requirements]

### 2. Deployment and Scaling Strategies  
[Include subtopics about autoscaling, load balancing, and traffic management]

### 3. Production Operations and Reliability
[Include subtopics about monitoring, incident response, and maintaining SLOs]

### 4. Platform Engineering and Automation (if applicable)
[Include subtopics about abstractions, developer experience, and continuous optimization]

For each subtopic use this structure:

#### X.X [Subtopic Name] ⭐ (mark if critical for production)
- **Concept**: Brief description focusing on WHY this matters for SREs/platform engineers (2-3 sentences)
- **Key Points**: 
  • [4-5 bullet points with specific, actionable operational information]
  • [Include metrics, thresholds, configuration examples]
  • [Focus on tools, commands, and configurations]
  • [Each point should be immediately applicable]
- **Real-World Case Study**: [Specific example of a company implementing this in production, with problem faced, solution implemented, and measurable outcome]
- **Research References**: 
  • [Technical documentation or runbook]
  • [Engineering blog post from a major tech company]
  • [Tool documentation or GitHub repository]

## Learning Path Recommendations

### Optimal Study Order for SREs:
- Provide a numbered sequence optimized for operational readiness
- Explain which topics enable immediate production improvements
- Identify foundational topics that unlock other capabilities

### Parallel Learning Tracks:
- Group topics by operational themes (Reliability, Efficiency, Automation)
- Show which topics can be learned independently
- Suggest tracks based on current role focus

### Quick Wins (Implement in Week 1):
- List 3-4 immediate improvements that can be implemented
- Focus on high-impact, low-effort changes
- Include specific metrics to measure success

## Current SRE-Focused Trends
[3-4 trends specifically relevant to operations/platform engineering]
- **Trend Name (Timeline)**
  - How this impacts daily operations
  - Tools or platforms leading this trend
  - Why SREs should care about this

## Important Instructions:
1. **Operational Focus**: Every topic should be presented from an infrastructure/operations perspective
2. **Tool-Specific**: Name specific tools, platforms, and technologies (not generic concepts)
3. **Metrics-Driven**: Include specific metrics, thresholds, and KPIs throughout
4. **Production-Ready**: Focus on what works in production, not theoretical best practices
5. **Hands-On**: Include configuration examples, commands, and practical implementations
6. **Cost-Aware**: Consider cost implications and FinOps practices where relevant
7. **Incident-Focused**: Include failure modes, debugging approaches, and recovery procedures
8. **Automation-First**: Emphasize automation opportunities and Infrastructure-as-Code
9. **Scale Considerations**: Address how approaches change at different scales
10. **Security and Compliance**: Include operational security practices where relevant

Avoid:
- Deep theoretical concepts without operational relevance
- Development-focused topics (algorithms, data structures)
- Business strategy or product management aspects
- Generic advice without specific implementation details

Remember: The goal is to create a roadmap that an SRE can follow to become operationally proficient, with immediate applicability to their daily work. Every subtopic should answer "How do I implement and operate this in production?"
